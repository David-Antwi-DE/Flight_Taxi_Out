#Predicting Taxi Out Delay:  Linear Regression Approach

##Dataset & Conrtent
This data contains flight details taking off from JFK airport. 
This data was scraped under a Academic Paper under Review by IEEE transportation
This file contains data about flights leaving from JKF ariport between Nov 2019-Dec-2020. Taxi-Out prediction has been an important concept as it helps in calculating Runway time and directly impact the cost of the flight.


###Background
In the highly complex and dynamic world of aviation, taxi out delays significantly impact airline schedules, passenger satisfaction, and operational efficiency. Taxi out delay refers to the time taken for an aircraft to taxi from the gate to the runway before takeoff. Understanding and predicting these delays can help airlines optimize their operations and improve overall efficiency.

###Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the flight take-off data from JFK Airport to predict taxi out delays using a linear regression model. By conducting thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and implementing a predictive model, we aim to gain valuable insights and provide actionable recommendations to minimize delays.
Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed flight take-off data from JFK Airport. The dataset includes various features such as month, day of the month, day of the week, departure delay, CRS elapsed time, distance, CRS departure time, actual departure time, CRS arrival time, and temperature.


###Methodology
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Perform initial analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
o	Visualize data distributions, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies or missing values.
2.	Data Cleaning:
o	Handle missing or invalid data.
o	Transform data as necessary for analysis (e.g., converting times to a consistent format).
3.	Model Implementation:
o	Implement a linear regression model to predict taxi out delays.
o	Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Findings and Recommendations
The findings from this analysis will be presented, highlighting key insights and patterns discovered during the EDA. The performance of the linear regression model will be assessed, and recommendations will be made to mitigate taxi out delays at JFK Airport
